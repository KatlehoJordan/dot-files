# MS Office Themes

This repository is a copy of `C/Users/<user>/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Templates` from my computer.

It apparently includes MS Office themes for Microsoft word, powerpoint, and perhaps excel.

Specifically:

- `Normal.dotm` seems to have the template for Word.
- `Document Themes/DGL.thmx` seems to have the template for Powerpoint.
- `Templates/Document Themes/Theme Colors/DGL.xml` has some hex values for colors.
