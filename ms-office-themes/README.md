# MS Office Themes

This folder is a copy of `~/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Templates` from my Dell computer used through 2023.

I thought it had MS Office themes for Microsoft word, powerpoint, and excel. The only one that clearly works is for Word.

## MS Word

`Normal.dotm` seems to have the template for Word. After copying this to `~/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Templates` opening Word will open a copy of this file which has your colors and fonts.

## MS Powerpoint and Excel

Copying the contents of `~/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Templates/Document Themes` will make your colors and fonts available in Powerpoint and Excel. One must actively select the 'DGL' theme in those software to access your theme, but it should be available.
