windows manager: i3
uses alt 1 or alt 2 or alt 3 to bounce between workspaces
- If using windows as the modifier key, relatively intuitive to bounce between apps (windows + arrow)
- Also easy to move them (windows + shift + arrow)
- Also easy to move between workspaces (windows + number)
- Also easy to move apps to other workspaces (windows + shift + number)
- Need to remap keys:
    - Maybe this will help? https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1496/change-caps-lock-to-esc-in-i3.1.html
    - These two remove caps lock functionality completely without moving it to escape key
    	- xmodmap -e "clear lock"
    	- xmodmap -e "keysym Caps_lock = Escape"
    	- Alternatively try:
    		- setxkbmap -layout us -option caps:escape
    - Adds escape but does not remove caps lock: https://jaketrent.com/post/remap-keys-i3/
        - xmodmap -e "keycode 66 = Escape NoSymbol Escape"
    - Not sure if this would work if done first: https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/2xoo9m/what_is_the_best_way_to_remap_ctrlkey_with/?rdt=57123
        - setxkbmap -option escape:swapcaps
- Mouse continuity between screens is not as intuitive (left to right, not top to bottom)
- Need to find out to create new workspaces for further extensibility
- also, using open from tmux here seems to lock the terminal session until the opened file is closed (I don't think I saw this in the non-i3 windows manager)
- also keeps logging me out of/breaking Google Chrome sync (if do not exit gracefully first)

- key shortcuts to know
    - windows + enter (launch a terminal)
    - windows + shift + q (kill an application)
    - windows + shift + e (end i3 session)
    - windows + d (search for an app to start)

terminal: tmux
