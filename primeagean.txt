## vim

I know vim already

## windows manager: i3

https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#:~:text=2.10.-,Exiting%20i3,you%20really%20want%20to%20quit.

- If using windows as the modifier key, relatively intuitive to bounce between apps (windows + arrow)
- Also easy to move them (windows + shift + arrow)
- Also easy to move between workspaces (windows + number)
- Also easy to move apps to other workspaces (windows + shift + number)

- key shortcuts to know
    - windows + enter (launch a terminal)
    - windows + shift + q (kill an application)
    - windows + shift + x (end i3 session) - then key based on prompt
    - windows + shift + e (end i3 session)
    - windows + d (search for an app to start)

### Problems

- NOT FIXED
    - Failed to shut down from i3 successfully last time, requiring a hard shut down

- INCOMPLETELY FIXED
    - Mouse continuity between screens is not as intuitive (left to right, not top to bottom)

        - To see displays: `xrandr`
        - To then rearrange displays: `xrandr --output <name of upper display> --above <name of lower display>
            - Other directions: --below --right-of --left-of
            - https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Xorg_RandR_1.2
        - I have put this in my config, but WARNING, this will not work on other machines if the display names are not identical to those on my home setup
    - also keeps logging me out of/breaking Google Chrome sync (if do not exit gracefully first)
        - Exit all apps gracefully (windows + shift + q) before exiting i3
    - also, using open from tmux here seems to lock the terminal session until the opened file is closed (I don't think I saw this in the non-i3 windows manager)
        - https://superuser.com/questions/513496/how-can-i-run-a-command-from-the-terminal-without-blocking-it
        - when using `open`, append with ` & disown` to keep the terminal active and dissociate the terminal from the running application
    - also does not use code to open text files when using `open`
        - Just have to be disciplined and use `code <my file>`
    - Upon starting up Linux kernel, getting error messages printed to the log:
        - https://www.kubuntuforums.net/forum/currently-supported-releases/kubuntu-22-04-jammy-jellyfish/post-installation-ax/662598-boot-shut-down-errors-acpi-error-no-pointer-back-to-namespace-node-in-package
        - Basically, these warnings are unavoidable on some motherboards when running linux. But they are non-harmful.
            - ACPI Error: No pointer back to namespace node in package (____ptr

    - Need to remap keys:
        - Maybe this will help? https://faq.i3wm.org/question/1496/change-caps-lock-to-esc-in-i3.1.html
        - These two remove caps lock functionality completely without moving it to escape key
            - xmodmap -e "clear lock"
            - xmodmap -e "keysym Caps_lock = Escape"
            - Alternatively try:
                - setxkbmap -layout us -option caps:escape
        - Adds escape but does not remove caps lock: https://jaketrent.com/post/remap-keys-i3/
            - xmodmap -e "keycode 66 = Escape NoSymbol Escape"
        - Not sure if this would work if done first: https://www.reddit.com/r/i3wm/comments/2xoo9m/what_is_the_best_way_to_remap_ctrlkey_with/?rdt=57123
            - setxkbmap -option escape:swapcaps

    - Need to find out to create new workspaces for further extensibility
        - Choose an open application, then use windows + shift + <number> to create the new workspace
